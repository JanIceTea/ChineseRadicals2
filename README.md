# Fun with Radicals!

### Objectiv
欢迎 (huānyíng/welcome)to Fun with Radicals! 
A Radical is a component of a Chinese character. The word for radical in Chinese is 偏旁 (piānpáng), or simply 旁 (páng). This component can help us understand the character’s meaning.  There are over 200 radicals! 
This app aims to give you more insight into Chinese characters by going through these radicals and learn common words which use them.
The radicals are divided into lessons after each there will be a short test to practice your knowledge. This test can be a multiple choice test or an overview of characters with the question to select the ones which contain a certain radical.
Please also take a look at the document: radicals_test.docx for more examples and explanations.

### Prototype
The prototype here shows an example of a beginner's lesson with 3 radicals and their description. The user can tap on a character and get more information about it.

### Future work
The review has not been implemented and needs some more thought.
